NoteTrack

This app is built with WinForms and was built to facilitate studying software development.
You can create multiple "sets", each of which can contain multiple topics. Each topic has a text editor with basic formatting and an option to attach and play local videos that are relevant for each particular topic.
Text is saved in RTF format and each set/topic is saved in a simple folder structure in the app's executable location in case you need to move the notes somewhere else.

What works:
1) Display a list of existing sets @ main page
2) Add a new Set with one Topic
3) Add a new Topic
4) Create thumbnails for videos for each topic
5) Play a video
6) Navigate back from Add view > Main page, from Topic view > Main page
7) Change text bold, underline and italic attributes with buttons and shortcut keys
8) Rename set
9) Delete topic

Planned features:
* Pressing TAB inside editor moves string multiple spaces
* Video name on mouse over event
* Select and delete a video
* Play a youtube video when clicking a link in the text editor
* Implement SQL database for saved data

Known limitations:
* Current version allows only alphanumeric characters to be used in the set/topic names, not including diacritics
* Direct manipulation of folder/file structure might result in app breaking
